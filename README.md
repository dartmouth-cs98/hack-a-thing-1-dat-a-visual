### Pivot 1: Data Visualization with Pandas
#### Managing Sneks (Python) with Conda (a sad story by Stephen)
[https://conda.io/docs/index.html] "Conda is an open source package management system and environment management system that runs on Windows, macOS and Linux."

As we work with Python and several data visualization libraries such as `pandas` and `seaborn`, Conda helps us maintain our development environment.

- I start by creating a new Python 3 environment `conda create --name pandas_tutorial python=3.6`.

- Installing `pandas` is as easy as running `conda install pandas`.

Ok turns out this was **not as easy as I thought it would be**. I ended up following the kaggle tutorial with PyCharm's virtual environment and installing packages with pip..which leads me to:

#### Semi-Success Story Told by Shirley - Plotnine & Panda

I could install pandas and plotnine using pip. I followed the tutorial using a wine dataset, and found two other datasets to visualize- McDonald's menu and restaurant ratings. 

I tried using simple graphs and more fancy looking graphs with themes. However I realized quickly that this was not going to become any more interesting unless I had access to some cool datasets which was more of a finding problem than a CS problem.

### Unity 
#### Zombie Game - Shirley

This game is made from a tutorial on Unity.com
I followed the ten phases: environment set up, setting characters, setting camera, creating two enemies, creating UI component HUD, adding player health, ability to damage health, score points, randomly spawn multiple enemies, and adding game over video
The goal of the game is to shoot the zombunny and zombears that come attacking you!
